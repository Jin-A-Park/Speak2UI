# Speak2UI: Voice-Driven Assistive Interfaces for Precision Mobile Accessibility

This study proposes "Speak2UI", a novel voice-based mobile UI control system that leverages pre-trained large language models to minimize data dependency and enable direct voice control of low-level UI elements. The system comprises Voice Activity Detection-based speech recognition, GPT-4o-mini command parsing supporting ten action types with context-aware filtering, and UI control modules. Performance evaluation compared command recognition accuracy with the existing system.
